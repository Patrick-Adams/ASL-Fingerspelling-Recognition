# ASL Fingerspelling Recognition Project

## Overview
This project aims to enhance American Sign Language (ASL) fingerspelling recognition using neural network models, focusing on LSTM, GRU, and TCN.

## Methodology
1. **Data Acquisition and Analysis**
2. **Preprocessing**
3. **Model Development**
4. **Model Comparison**
5. **Optimization**

## Results
- High test accuracy (98.5%).
- TCN model selected for further optimization.

## Future Work
Including data augmentation, transfer learning, and real-time processing optimizations.
